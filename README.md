# Analyzing the Effectiveness of Personalized v/s Non-Personalized Advertising Messages in Consumers' Purchasing Decisions.

This Study dives into the changes in the behaviour of the consumer when Personalised Advertising Message are sent in context of Marketing. With the Advancement in the Digital Marketing Channels, 
the marketers are open to a wide variety of channels which include Personalised and Non
Personalised Advertising Messages. There has been a debate all around regarding which form is more 
effective when compared to the other. We will be using Logistic Regression to find out the impact of 
personalised message while taking into account some other important variable of our Research which 
are Demographic Characteristics, Brand Attitudes, Purchase Intentions, Prior Brand Loyalty, etc. A 
dummy dataset with 100 datapoints of each variable has been used for the analysis. The results will 
provide us with insights regarding the medium of Advertising Messages that are to be used varying 
from Customer to Customer and Product to Product.
